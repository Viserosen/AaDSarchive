### 5 sorting

Program implementing 5 different sorting algorithm.

- Quick sort
- Quick sort iterative
- Merge sort
- Shell sort + Insert sort
- Heap sort

With random data series generator (if n > 10) in 5 different forms.

##### Output:

Time taken by program and sorted set from high to low.

##### Shell sort output:

Number of jumps and all jumps
Time taken by program and sorted set from high to low.

### AVL and BST generator

Generates AVL and BST. Not finished algorithms based on AVL and BST.

### binary tree example

Generating random binart tree and search for max number.

### DFS example

Prints graph from input, Depth First Search and if Euleran path and circuit exist.

### Hamilton and Euler solver

Searches for Hamiltonian path and Euleran circuit.

### V series generator

Generate a sequence of numbers where the odd numbers appear first in descending order, followed by the even numbers in ascending order.

### Knapsack problem
